FastAPI endpoints for account creation and login.

Implementation Plan
Create endpoints for creating a user and logging in. Until the authentication service is integrated with NTC, we need a set of simple dummy endpoint to connect to the login page for testing the user flow. The dummy endpoints will interact with CosmosDB rather than the Auth Enclave wrappers. So when a user creates an account, save their username and password in Cosmos, login would just check that they are the same.

"38ntjaz","As a Vault User I want the management of data, DRTs and results secured with a password so that only I can issue perform actions on my behalf (SIGNUP & LOGIN)","","","","complete","Background
The Vault User needs to have some way of signing up for the service and securing the management of their packages, DRT's and redemption results behind an auth. We will use Nautilus wallets with Algorand accounts so that users can integrate with smart contracts. 
In the future we will provide multiple options for wallet/vault creation:
Generate a Nautilus wallet for each Vault account.
Create a wallet on behalf of users but leave private keys  are sealed by the enclave. 
For the MVP however we will first develop a Vault app that creates an Algorand account for all new users and uses the existing wallet backend to sign transactions. 

For more information Refer to the ""Notes on Authentication"" section of the below doc:
 Notes for Post MVP:
Allow users to use add their own Algorand wallet or
Promote the use of the NW. Single sign on for both wallet & NTC. A Nautilus Wallet is created and associated with the Vault account, with the Vault password used to seal the wallet key.  In this way we can eliminate the need for a separate wallet PIN and Vault username and password.
Reproduce authentication plan for Nautilus Wallet.
Determine how password pepper and username will be used to seal datasets, ensuring that authentication is compatible.
Determine how to use the username and enclave key to seal blockchain key.
Provide necessary API functions for the NCT Vault applications for create_user and login.
Implement JWT token system for Vault sessions.

Acceptance Criteria
Each user is prompted to set a public username(email for now) and private password upon their first visit.
A Nautilus Vault account is created. The vault account includes private keys to sign transactions from an Algorand wallet.

Implementation Plan
Dockerise the backend of the old wallet auth
Set up the SGX VM ($70/month) - Check the VM Joe set up on 03/03/2023

"38ntrua","Frontend to manage data packages & issue DRTs","","","","blocked","Description
Add page to UI that allows a data pool creator to issue a DRT on a pool they have created. They will be able to select from a list of available execution DRTs provided by an API endpoint and correlate it with a data pool. This will also correspond with one or more calls to the Algorand SDK to modify the smart contract.

Implementation Plan
Review figma diagrams and create design for ""manage data pool"" page DONE
Create code to call Tokens API to get a list of executables that are already assigned to the data pool, and the list that are available (maybe grey out the ones that are already issued)
Ensure that the correct transactions are initiated to the MVP Smart Contract or coordinate with Alex to this end

"38nthe6","As a data creator I want to be able to CREATE a DATA POOL so that I can increase the value of the data","","","","development","Background
Data creators need to be able to secure their data with the enclave via the app with a simple interface to upload. Data creators need to be able to upload a schema and select digital rights associated.

Data creators need to be able to grant access to data contributors to a pool. This will be managed by an append DRT which a contributor must purchase to add their data to the data pool.  

Once the data creator is logged in, she sees a list of all her data pools below a button to create a new pool.

Once a data creator clicks to create a new pool, she is guided through a four-plus-one step process. First, she defines a data schema for the pool by uploading a schema. Second, she selects the file containing one or multiple rows of data conforming to the schema. The user receives 1 contributor token, which is a DRT. Fourth, the data is uploaded. And fifth, the data creator selects from a list of data rights that are available for the pool. Data rights are initially defined by Nautilus.

Notes for post-MVP:
Initially, users can have only one wallet, but we aim to allow them to have multiple wallets and to select a preferred wallet for each pool.  
It is also possible to skip the step of adding digital rights and add data rights later.
We aim to have functionality for users to create new data rights.

Functionality that alreday exists on the backend:
The data creator will be able to set the price of the AppendDRT. 
The data creator can change the price of any DRT at any time.
The data creator determines the DRTs that are executable against the pool by issuing additional DRTs.

Acceptance Criteria
Data creator can upload via file explorer or drag and drop,
Data creator can select/upload a data schema,
The dataset is validated and accepted/rejected according to the data schema,
Metadata for public view can be specified e.g:
Name of data package,
Description,
Schema of Data
The data creator can issue an AppendDRT to join the pool. (NB: All DRTs have a fixed price (5 Algos) during MVP)

Implementation Plan
Implement Algorand smart contract according to criteria in subtask.
Set up python methods to link the Algorand SDK to NTC client.
Create FastAPI endpoints for 'create_datapool', 'get_datapool_by_user', 'get_all_datapool',
Link Contributor token to data pool in the DB
Set up execution enclave, data service and methods for sealing data in the data base. 
Create databases MongoDB schemas for datasets, users, data types (schemas) - 
Write Rust Append function (implementing AppendDRT) that can use arbitrary columns

To create a new dataset we need an API so that the client application can communicate with our enclave and database. The API should include the following endpoints:

store_data: call this method with the data file and associated metadata. 
the data file would be transferred directly to the enclave to be validated and sealed
the sealed data would then be transferred to the database
metadata would be transferred to the same document as the dataset, unsealed
retrieve_data_info: get metadata for a data file by ID that is stored in the smart contract or drt for listing datasets on the marketplace
retrieve_data: get sealed data from database by file ID, transfer to enclave
search_data: search dataset metadata by keyword or other criteria 

Notes:
A rust implementation was started including metadata and other functions, See section 2.4.3 - PR. We implement this in Python. 

Implementation Plan 
Set up Python FastAPI backend for NTC using NW as a template.
Reproduce the first two endpoints using the PR #69 as a starting point.
Test upload and retrieve API calls from javascript
Notes
The APIs connect to CosmosDB and can upload data and query data using specific fields. Currently this is the format for CosmosDB:

{
	""_id"" : ObjectId(""63612d200d0cc3d50ecda3b5""),
	""user_id"" : ""Test Client 01"",
	""pool_name"" : ""NTLS first pool"",

The enclave needs to create & sign a setup transaction during the setup of the smart contract / data pool. 

This task is similar to the Enclave Transaction: Add data contributor task in that it follows similar logic. During the series of transaction to create the smart contract, one of the transactions deals with the smart contracts setup and this transaction tells the smart contract the details for the creators initial data contribution i.e. how many rows of data and the new hash of the data. 

This information needs to come from a trusted source, therefore it has to be constructed within the enclave. 
We will make use of the execution enclave to create the transaction and then use the old auth signing enclave to sign the transaction. The two enclaves would in theory communicate via local attestation however, given MVP constraints a secure communication channel is all that is needed and this can be implemented via a standard public/private key pair encryption method. 

Therefore, before this task can commence, there needs to be a secure communication channel setup between the two enclaves. 

Implementation Plan
Setup secure communication channel between the execution enclave and the old auth signing enclave. Before commencing the build double check the chosen encryption method with   ,   and   . If unsure on where to access the two enclaves, speak to  .
Create a function in the execution enclave that counts the numbers of rows of data being added by the contributor.
Create a function that compiles a hash of the new data pool's data package with the appended data. 
Use the above functions to build an Algorand transaction in the execution enclave. 
Build ""setup"" transaction in the execution enclave.
Transaction Type: Application Call
Index = unique application ID that represents the smart contract
Application call arguments (the order is important)
       ""init_contract"",
        number of Rows Contributed,
        data Package Hash,
        append DRT Name 
        appendDRTUnitName,
        append DRT Supply,
        append DRT Price,
        append DRT BinaryUrl,
        append DRT Binary Hash,
Application call accounts array:
address of data contributors algorand wallet.
Details of the application transaction call can be seen in the python build of the transaction found in the python SDK here under the ""initialiseDataPool"" function. 
Pass the transaction through the encrypted channel to the old auth signing enclave. 
Sign the transaction in the old auth signing enclave
Pass the signed transaction out. 

Acceptance criteria
There is a secure communication channel between two enclaves
Execution enclave can count the amount of rows of data being appended
Execution enclave can generate a hash of the new dataset with the old and new data

Javascript SDK being completed as a part of the Create pool user story is a dependency for this user story to be completed

Once selected, a workflow with four steps starts. First, the user must purchase an AppendDRT using funds in her numeraire wallet. Users are notified if they have insufficient funds and the flow terminates. Second, once the user purchases an AppendDRT, it is transferred to the user’s wallet. Third, the AppendDRT is transferred from the user’s wallet to the smart contract managing the data pool. This step is necessary so the smart contract has proof that the AppendDRT was sent by its new owner. Fourth, once the smart contract has received the AppendDRT, the data upload workflow starts.

In this workflow, the user is asked to upload the data. We aim that the system verifies that the data file corresponds to the schema of the data pool that is being joined. This validation functionality is developed as a separate task but needs to be integrated with this page. Once the files are uploaded, the user receives a Contributor Token and a confirmation message that the contribution was successful.

If an analyst purchases a DRT for the data pool, data contributors receive royalties into her numeraire wallet proportional to the sample size of their data.

Acceptance Criteria
The user is able to view a list of data pools
The user is shown a button to pool their data
The user is shown the cost of append DRT to join the pool
After purchasing a DRT, the 
After purchasing the DRT, the user is shown a page to upload a dataset

The append DRT is purchased and redeemed in quick succession (Abstracted away from the user who will just see a spinning wheel)
The users wallet receives a contributor token(s)
The user is shown a success page

Implementation Plan
Javascript SDK for joining a pool and claiming contributor token 
Make sure the following integrations (completed in other tasks) work with the frontend:
Data schema validation JS code
Smart contract JS SDK code (check funds, purchase DRT, redeem DRT)
Verify the user has enough funds to purchase the appendDRT, to send it back to the smartcontract & for the flat execution fee.
Redeem the AppendDRT and return the status of the append

Create an Oracle Node for verifying DRT redemption. 
We need at least one Oracle node to verify DRT redemptions. This consists of a Python function that queries the Algorand blockchain when queried by the Execution service, and returns information from the DRT that is being executed. 

Implementation Plan
We have an ntc-oracle-node written in Rust. However, it isn't neccessary to use Rust/Alognaut and it will save time to implement it using python. However, please refer to the ntc-oracle-node directory in nautilus-trusted-compute to see how it was done before.
Use the py-algorand-sdk to create a function that queries the Algorand blockchain.
The Oracle node will need to first create a ""client"" connection to the algorand blockchain. 

The node will then query the following information:
Query the ""pending contributor status"" of a users given address for a data pool. The status will sit in the box storage of the smart contract. 
There are more queries needed, ( I need to chat with   and Co, to go through the specifics)

Deploy it to a container on the backend services VM (or get someone to do it for you, lol)

Acceptance Criteria
The data service can provide two datasets and two dataset hashes and return a combined dataset and a new hash. It returns appropriate errors upon failure. 

Implementation plan
Write code to append two json files, assuming they've already been validated 
A WASM function already exists: https://github.com/ntls-io/wasm-exec-sgx/blob/wasm-append/enclave/src/lib.rs.
Use the dataset hashing function to compare the hash of the two datasets to the hashes provided by the input.
I believe we will need to create an ECAL for an append function, sending a dataset in and returning a status.
Create generalized Rust code that can append JSON files with columns of arbitrary number and type.
Handle any errors with the execution of the append by returning an error to the API. Preferably an error with something useful (i.e. a file format error, a data type error - a string in a float column, etc, corrupt data, etc)
Recompute the hash of the combined dataset if append is successful.
Create a python wrapper for the append function

When you join a pool, the AppendDRT needs to be purchased & sent back to the smart contract. This task deals with the orchestration of Append operations the smart contract side. 

Implementation Plan
Vault API
Query a list of active data pools.
Current GET Data pools endpoint queries the MongoDB by using a wallet_id.
Store DRTs purchased by the user, remove from list when redeemed
Create a STORE DRT api endpoint that takes information about DRT, and stores it to MongoDB.
DRT information stored: Wallet ID, DRT type (analysis binary), DRT creator, current registered owner of DRT, reference of data pool (algorand address), listed/delisting/available parameter, drt_type
A user gets a list of all Append DRTs available for purchase (or all data pools with available append DRTs) - write an api endpoint /drts/get_by_type(drt_type, available==True)
Api endpoint to alter the current registered owner of the DRT on the smartcontract and update MongoDB. If 1 DRT is purchased update 1 DRT with matching asset ID in the DB. 
Call to data service with data file for appending
User redeems Append DRT. When user clicks redeem the Front end sends drt directly to smart contract. The transaction will have a transactionID. 
On the next page when transactionID is given, User uploads their data. 
Call the execution service & seal data. We add their wallet address with that request.
Send request to authentication service. The Auth service will take the transaction ID and query oracle node(s).
Oracle nodes return information about DRT. If 
Accept data during API call to the mongoDB for the datapool Hash, along with DRT address and DRT owner wallet
Call Algorand SDK function to write transaction for DRT redemption
This transaction should be signed and submitted as the last step
Call the execution service with the dataset to execute the Append function
The execution service is a separate task, but will verify the append DRT using an Oracle node query and then communicate with the enclave, wait for the result of the append, which will include a new hash for the data as well as a new row count.
Get enclave result.
if step iii returns an error, return an exception to the frontend, this is the end of the API call.
If step iii is successful, finish the Algorand transaction for redeem DRT (speak to Alex about this) and send this to the signing enclave to be signed. 
Call the Agorand SDK function to update the smart contract with the new row count and dataset hash

API functions
/DRT/get_by_type
return data pools corresponding to each DRT, or to group by data pool - speak with Jonathan about what is best
/DRT/create
/DRT/update
/DRT/purchase
/DRT/redeem - to use this for append it needs to accept a data file blob, we can add this as an optional parameter, or create a separate /DRT/append endpoint

The ""pending data contributor"" will essentially hold the users contribution in escrow on the smart contract until the enclave has approved the specifics of the users contribution. Reason being is that those specific details needs to come from a trusted source - the enclave.

Implementation Plan

Create another function in smart contract code to add the user into a pending contributor state in box storage
create another function to take in enclaves approval to transfer the users state from pending to confirmed and register details in box storage

"862jcjxc9","Enclave Transaction: Add data contributor","","","","development","Background
Create an ""add data contributor transaction"" within the enclave and sign it. 

For new users to contribute to a data pool, an instruction needs to come from within the enclave to tell the smart contract who the smart contract must add to the pool, how much they are contributing and what the new hash of the data is. This is to protect the smart contract / data pool from being told false information. 
The same applies for the creation of a smart contract and its ""setup"" instruction when the data pool creator creates the pool and appends its first data. 

We will make use of the execution enclave to create the transaction and then use the old auth signing enclave to sign the transaction. The two enclaves would in theory communicate via local attestation however, given MVP constraints a secure communication channel is all that is needed and this can be implemented via a standard public/private key pair encryption method. Therefore, before this task can commence, there needs to be a secure communication channel setup between the two enclaves. 

Implementation Plan
Use the functions created in the previous task to build an algorand transaction in the execution enclave. 
Build ""add_data_contributor"" transaction in the execution enclave.
Transaction Type: Application Call
Index = unique application ID that represents the smart contract
Application call arguments (the order is important)
""add_data_contributor"",
number of Rows Contributed,
new data Package Hash,
enclave approval
Application call accounts array:
address of data contributors algorand wallet.
Details of the application transaction call can be seen in the python build of the transaction found in the python SDK here under the ""initialiseDataPool"" function. 
Pass the transaction through the encrypted channel to the old auth signing enclave. 
Sign the transaction in the old auth signing enclave
Pass the signed transaction out back to the frontend. 

Acceptance criteria
The ""add_data_contributor' transaction can be compiled in the execution enclave properly. 
The old auth enclave can sign the above transaction and the smart contract can told the correct information to add a new data contributor

We need to manage the compute resources that are used to execute DRTs. Refer to the Research Notes document for details on implementation. Basically we need to limit execution time, cancel jobs that use all funds, and return the cost of an execution and initiate a transaction to charge for computation or refund unused funds, depending on the implementation.

For the MVP we will set a flat fee for any DRT redemption. So the fee can be set in the smart contract code if necessary. This will be one of the first things to be replaced with a dynamic pricing and repeat billing process in phase 1.

The owner of a DRT must be stored and updated when sold on a secondary market in order for Nautilus to earn royalties from DRT sales. The previous plan was to use the SC global variables to register the DRT owner. However, we are limited to 50 global key-value pairs, so this puts a limit on the number of DRTs we can issue. 

The alternative is to make use of the box storage that is associated with each DRT, rather than global storage is associated with a smart contract and local storage is associated with a wallet. This would remove the limit on the number of DRTs that can be issued by a smart contract. It also is generally practise to use the box storage for this type of storage on the smart contract. Box storage is a new feature of algorand that Alex is already using to store the variables required for contributor tokens. The box storage can store more in its key value pair should we want to add more data pegged to the DRT.

We will have to go through the documentation with a fine comb because it changes the fundamental design of the smart contract.

See slack discussion on DRT box storage for more info.

Implementation Plan
Modify executable contributor token DRT creation to include a reference to the owner 
Add and revise existing documentation to reflect these changes
Create tests for creating and transferring a DRT between owners

"862j8r123","Update algorand signing enclave","","","","requirements capture","Description
The wallet has only been used for XRP transactions. For NTC we need a signing enclave to sign Algo transactions. There is code for doing this using the Algonaut library, but we need to test it and update, if necessary.

Implementation Plan:
Review existing code and update it or expand it so the wallet can sign Algo transactions. 
Create an Algo wallet enclave, hopefully copied from the 
Create Algo FastAPI endpoints for signing transactions, similar to the XRP endpoints.

Time Estimate:
1 week
